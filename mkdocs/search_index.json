Documentation\nsource files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML\nconfiguration file.\n\n\nHost anywhere\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBuilds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon\nS3, or anywhere else you choose.\n\n\nGreat themes available\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere's a stack of good looking themes included by default. Choose from\nbootstrap, readthedocs, or any of the 12 bootswatch themes.\n\n\nPreview your site as you work\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe built-in devserver allows you to preview your documentation as you're\nwriting it. It will even auto-reload whenever you save any changes, so all you\nneed to do to see your latest edits is refresh your browser.\n\n\nEasy to customize\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGet your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing\nthe theme.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn order to install MkDocs you'll need \nPython\n installed on your system, as\nwell as the Python package manager, \npip\n. You can check if you have these\nalready installed like so:\n\n\n$ python --version\nPython 2.7.2\n$ pip --version\npip 1.5.2\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.\n\n\nOn Windows we recommend that you install Python and pip with \nChocolatey\n.\n\n\nInstall the \nmkdocs\n package using pip:\n\n\npip install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\nYou should now have the \nmkdocs\n command installed on your system. Run \nmkdocs\n--version\n to check that everything worked okay.\n\n\n$ mkdocs --version\nmkdocs, version 0.15.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGetting started is super easy.\n\n\nmkdocs new my-project\ncd my-project\n\n\n\n\nLet's take a moment to review the initial project that's been created for us.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a single configuration file named \nmkdocs.yml\n, and a folder named\n\ndocs\n that will contain our documentation source files. Right now the \ndocs\n\nfolder just contains a single documentation page, named \nindex.md\n.\n\n\nMkDocs comes with a built-in webserver that lets you preview your documentation\nas you work on it. We start the webserver by making sure we're in the same\ndirectory as the \nmkdocs.yml\n config file, and then running the \nmkdocs serve\n\ncommand:\n\n\n$ mkdocs serve\nRunning at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n\n\n\n\nOpen up \nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/\n in your browser, and\nyou'll see the index page being displayed:\n\n\n\n\nThe webserver also supports auto-reloading, and will rebuild your documentation\nwhenever anything in the configuration file, documentation directory or theme\ndirectory changes.\n\n\nGo ahead and edit the \ndocs/index.md\n file now and save the file. Then simply\nhit reload in the browser and you'll see your updated documentation.\n\n\nNow's also a good time to edit the configuration file, \nmkdocs.yml\n. Change the\n\nsite_name\n setting to something else and save the file.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you hit reload in the browser you'll see your new site name take effect.\n\n\n\n\nAdding pages\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGo ahead and edit the \ndocs/index.md\n document, and change the initial heading to\n\nMkLorum\n, then reload the site in your browser, and you should see the change\ntake effect immediately.\n\n\nLet's also add a second page to our documentation:\n\n\ncurl 'jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt' \n docs/about.md\n\n\n\n\nWe'd like our documentation site to include some navigation headers, so we'll\nedit the configuration file and add some information about the order and title\nto use for out headers:\n\n\nsite_name: MkLorum\npages:\n- Home: index.md\n- About: about.md\n\n\n\n\nRefresh the browser and you'll now see a navigation bar with \nHome\n and \nAbout\n\nheaders.\n\n\nTheming our documentation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhile we're here can also change the configuration file to alter how the\ndocumentation is displayed. Let's go ahead and change the theme. Edit the\n\nmkdocs.yml\n file to the following:\n\n\nsite_name: MkLorum\npages:\n- Home: index.md\n- About: about.md\ntheme: readthedocs\n\n\n\n\nRefresh the browser again, and you'll now see the ReadTheDocs theme being used.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the site\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThat's looking good. We're ready to deploy the first pass of our \nMkLorum\n\ndocumentation now. Let's build the documentation.\n\n\nmkdocs build\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a new directory, named \nsite\n. Let's take a look inside the\ndirectory:\n\n\nls site\nabout css fonts img index.html js\n\n\n\n\nNotice that our source documentation has been output as two HTML files named\n\nindex.html\n and \nabout/index.html\n. We also have various other media that's\nbeen copied into the \nsite\n directory as part of the documentation theme.\n\n\nIf you're using source code control such as \ngit\n you probably don't want to\ncheck your documentation builds into the repository. Add a line containing\n\nsite/\n to your \n.gitignore\n file.\n\n\necho \nsite/\n \n .gitignore\n\n\n\n\nIf you're using another source code control you'll want to check it's\ndocumentation on how to ignore specific directories.\n\n\nAfter some time, files may be removed from the documentation but they will still\nreside in the \nsite\n directory. To remove those stale files, just run mkdocs\nwith the \n--clean\n switch.\n\n\nmkdocs build --clean\n\n\n\n\nOther Commands and Options\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are various other commands and options available. For a complete list of\ncommands, use the \n--help\n flag:\n\n\nmkdocs --help\n\n\n\n\nTo view a list of options available on a given command, use the \n--help\n flag\nwith that command. For example, to get a list of all options available for the\n\nbuild\n command run the following:\n\n\nmkdocs build --help\n\n\n\n\nDeploying\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe documentation site that we've just built only uses static files so you'll be\nable to host it from pretty much anywhere. \nGitHub project pages\n and \nAmazon\nS3\n are good hosting options. Upload the contents of the entire \nsite\n directory\nto wherever you're hosting your website from and you're done. For specific\ninstructions for a number of common hosts, see the \nDeploying your Docs\n page.\n\n\nGetting help\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo get help with MkDocs, please use the \ndiscussion group\n, \nGitHub issues\n or\nthe MkDocs IRC channel \n#mkdocs\n on freenode.",

If not provided, the pages configuration will be\nautomatically created by discovering all the Markdown files in the\n\ndocumentation directory\n.\n\n\nA simple pages configuration looks like this:\n\n\npages:\n- 'index.md'\n- 'about.md'\n\n\n\n\nWith this example we will build two pages at the top level and they will\nautomatically have their titles inferred from the filename. Assuming \ndocs_dir\n\nhas the default value, \ndocs\n, the source files for this documentation would be\n\ndocs/index.md\n and \ndocs/about.md\n. To provide a custom name for these pages,\nthey can be added before the filename.\n\n\npages:\n- Home: 'index.md'\n- About: 'about.md'\n\n\n\n\nMultilevel documentation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSubsections can be created by listing related pages together under a section\ntitle. For example:\n\n\npages:\n- Home: 'index.md'\n- User Guide:\n    - 'Writing your docs': 'user-guide/writing-your-docs.md'\n    - 'Styling your docs': 'user-guide/styling-your-docs.md'\n- About:\n    - 'License': 'about/license.md'\n    - 'Release Notes': 'about/release-notes.md'\n\n\n\n\nWith the above configuration we have three top level sections: Home, User Guide\nand About. Then under User Guide we have two pages, Writing your docs and\nStyling your docs. Under the About section we also have two pages, License and\nRelease Notes.\n\n\nFile layout\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYour documentation source should be written as regular Markdown files, and\nplaced in a directory somewhere in your project. Normally this directory will be\nnamed \ndocs\n and will exist at the top level of your project, alongside the\n\nmkdocs.yml\n configuration file.\n\n\nThe simplest project you can create will look something like this:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    index.md\n\n\n\n\nBy convention your project homepage should always be named \nindex\n. Any of the\nfollowing extensions may be used for your Markdown source files: \nmarkdown\n,\n\nmdown\n, \nmkdn\n, \nmkd\n, \nmd\n.\n\n\nYou can also create multi-page documentation, by creating several markdown\nfiles:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    index.md\n    about.md\n    license.md\n\n\n\n\nThe file layout you use determines the URLs that are used for the generated\npages. Given the above layout, pages would be generated for the following URLs:\n\n\n/\n/about/\n/license/\n\n\n\n\nYou can also include your Markdown files in nested directories if that better\nsuits your documentation layout.\n\n\ndocs/\n    index.md\n    user-guide/getting-started.md\n    user-guide/configuration-options.md\n    license.md\n\n\n\n\nSource files inside nested directories will cause pages to be generated with\nnested URLs, like so:\n\n\n/\n/user-guide/getting-started/\n/user-guide/configuration-options/\n/license/\n\n\n\n\nLinking documents\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs allows you to interlink your documentation by using regular Markdown\nhyperlinks.\n\n\nInternal hyperlinks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen linking between pages in the documentation you can simply use the regular\nMarkdown hyperlinking syntax, including the relative path to the Markdown\ndocument you wish to link to.\n\n\nPlease see the [project license](license.md) for further details.\n\n\n\nWhen the MkDocs build runs, these hyperlinks will automatically be transformed\ninto a hyperlink to the appropriate HTML page.\n\n\nWhen working on your documentation you should be able to open the linked\nMarkdown document in a new editor window simply by clicking on the link.\n\n\nIf the target documentation file is in another directory you'll need to make\nsure to include any relative directory path in the hyperlink.\n\n\nPlease see the [project license](../about/license.md) for further details.\n\n\n\nYou can also link to a section within a target documentation page by using an\nanchor link. The generated HTML will correctly transform the path portion of the\nhyperlink, and leave the anchor portion intact.\n\n\nPlease see the [project license](about.md#license) for further details.\n\n\n\nImages and media\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs well as the Markdown source files, you can also include other file types in\nyour documentation, which will be copied across when generating your\ndocumentation site. These might include images and other media.\n\n\nFor example, if your project documentation needed to include a \nGitHub pages\nCNAME\nfile\n\nand a PNG formatted screenshot image then your file layout might look as\nfollows:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    CNAME\n    index.md\n    about.md\n    license.md\n    img/\n        screenshot.png\n\n\n\n\nTo include images in your documentation source files, simply use any of the\nregular Markdown image syntaxes:\n\n\nCupcake indexer is a snazzy new project for indexing small cakes.\n\n![Screenshot](img/screenshot.png)\n\n*Above: Cupcake indexer in progress*\n\n\n\n\nYou image will now be embedded when you build the documentation, and should also\nbe previewed if you're working on the documentation with a Markdown editor.\n\n\nMarkdown extensions\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs supports the following Markdown extensions.\n\n\nTables\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA simple table looks like this:\n\n\nFirst Header | Second Header | Third Header\n------------ | ------------- | ------------\nContent Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell\nContent Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table:\n\n\n| First Header | Second Header | Third Header |\n| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |\n| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |\n| Content Cell | Content Cell  | Content Cell |\n\n\n\n\nSpecify alignment for each column by adding colons to separator lines:\n\n\nFirst Header | Second Header | Third Header\n:----------- | :-----------: | -----------:\nLeft         | Center        | Right\nLeft         | Center        | Right\n\n\n\n\nFenced code blocks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe first line should contain 3 or more backtick (\n`\n) characters, and the\nlast line should contain the same number of backtick characters (\n`\n):\n\n\n```\nFenced code blocks are like Stardard\nMarkdown\u2019s regular code blocks, except that\nthey\u2019re not indented and instead rely on\nstart and end fence lines to delimit the\ncode block.\n```\n\n\n\n\nWith this approach, the language can optionally be specified on the first line\nafter the backticks:\n\n\n```python\ndef fn():\n    pass\n```",

Set to\ntrue to halt processing when a broken link is found, false prints a warning.\n\n\ndefault\n: \nfalse\n\n\ndev_addr\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDetermines the address used when running \nmkdocs serve\n. Setting this allows you\nto use another port, or allows you to make the service accessible over your\nlocal network by using the \n0.0.0.0\n address.\n\n\nAs with all settings, you can set this from the command line, which can be\nuseful, for example:\n\n\nmkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:80  # Run on port 80, on the local network.\n\n\n\n\ndefault\n: \n'127.0.0.1:8000'\n\n\nFormatting options\n\uf0c1\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs uses the \nPython Markdown\n library to translate Markdown files\ninto HTML. Python Markdown supports a variety of \nextensions\n\nthat customize how pages are formatted. This setting lets you enable a list of\nextensions beyond the ones that MkDocs uses by default (\nmeta\n, \ntoc\n, \ntables\n,\nand \nfenced_code\n).\n\n\nFor example, to enable the \nSmartyPants typography extension\n, use:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - smarty\n\n\n\n\nSome extensions provide configuration options of their own. If you would like to\nset any configuration options, then you can nest a key/value mapping\n(\noption_name: option value\n) of any options that a given extension supports.\nSee the documentation for the extension you are using to determine what options\nthey support.\n\n\nFor example, to enable permalinks in the (included) \ntoc\n extension, use:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - toc:\n        permalink: True\n\n\n\n\nNote that a colon (\n:\n) must follow the extension name (\ntoc\n) and then on a new\nline the option name and value must be indented and seperated by a colon. If you\nwould like to define multipe options for a single extension, each option must be\ndefined on a seperate line:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - toc:\n        permalink: True\n        separator: \n_\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an additional item to the list for each extension. If you have no\nconfiguration options to set for a specific extension, then simply omit options\nfor that extension:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    - smarty\n    - toc:\n        permalink: True\n    - sane_lists\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also:\n\n\nThe Python-Markdown documentation provides a \nlist of extensions\n\nwhich are available out-of-the-box. For a list of configuration options\navailable for a given extension, see the documentation for that extension.\n\n\nYou may also install and use various \nthird party extensions\n. Consult\nthe documentation provided by those extensions for installation instructions\nand available configuration options.\n\n\n\n\ndefault\n: \n[]",

This should be placed in a directory which will be the\n\ntheme_dir\n and it should be created next to the \nmkdocs.yml\n configuration\nfile. Within \nmkdocs.yml\n, specify the \ntheme_dir\n option and set it to the\nname of the directory containing \nbase.html\n. For example, given this example\nproject layout:\n\n\nmkdocs.yml\ndocs/\n    index.md\n    about.md\ncustom_theme/\n    base.html\n    ...\n\n\n\nYou would include the following setting to use the custom theme directory:\n\n\ntheme_dir: 'custom_theme'\n\n\n\nIf used in combination with the \ntheme\n configuration value a custom theme can\nbe used to replace only specific parts of a built-in theme. For example, with\nthe above layout and if you set \ntheme: mkdocs\n then the \nbase.html\n file\nwould replace that in the theme but otherwise it would remain the same. This\nis useful if you want to make small adjustments to an existing theme.\n\n\nBasic theme\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe simplest \nbase.html\n file is the following:\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n  \nhead\n\n    \ntitle\n{% if page_title %}{{ page_title }} - {% endif %}{{ site_name }}\n/title\n\n  \n/head\n\n  \nbody\n\n    {{ content }}\n  \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle content from each page specified in \nmkdocs.yml\n is inserted using the\n\n{{ content }}\n tag. Stylesheets and scripts can be brought into this theme as\nwith a normal HTML file. Navbars and tables of contents can also be generated\nand included automatically, through the \nnav\n and \ntoc\n objects, respectively.\nIf you wish to write your own theme, it is recommended to start with one of\nthe \nbuilt-in themes\n and modify it accordingly.\n\n\nTemplate Variables\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach template in a theme is built with a template context. These are the\nvariables that are available to themes. The context varies depending on the\ntemplate that is being built. At the moment templates are either built with\nthe global context or with a page specific context. The global context is used\nfor HTML pages that don't represent an individual Markdown document, for\nexample a 404.html page or search.html.\n\n\nGlobal Context\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following variables in the context map directly the \nconfiguration options\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\n\n\nConfiguration name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsite_name\n\n\nsite_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsite_author\n\n\nsite_author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon\n\n\nsite_favicon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npage_description\n\n\nsite_description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo_url\n\n\nrepo_url\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo_name\n\n\nrepo_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsite_url\n\n\nsite_url\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra_css\n\n\nextra_css\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra_javascript\n\n\nextra_javascript\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra\n\n\nextra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_nav\n\n\ninclude_nav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_next_prev\n\n\ninclude_next_prev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncopyright\n\n\ncopyright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngoogle_analytics\n\n\ngoogle_analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following variables provide information about the navigation and location.\n\n\nnav\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nnav\n variable is used to create the navigation for the documentation.\nFollowing is a basic usage example which outputs the first and second level\nnavigation as a nested list.\n\n\nul\n\n  {% for nav_item in nav %}\n      {% if nav_item.children %}\n          \nli\n{{ nav_item.title }}\n              \nul\n\n              {% for nav_item in nav_item.children %}\n                  \nli class=\n{% if nav_item.active%}current{%endif%}\n\n                      \na href=\n{{ nav_item.url }}\n{{ nav_item.title }}\n/a\n\n                  \n/li\n\n              {% endfor %}\n              \n/ul\n\n          \n/li\n\n      {% else %}\n          \nli class=\n{% if nav_item.active%}current{%endif%}\n\n              \na href=\n{{ nav_item.url }}\n{{ nav_item.title }}\n/a\n\n          \n/li\n\n      {% endif %}\n\n  {% endfor %}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\nbase_url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nbase_url\n provides a relative path to the root of the MkDocs project.\nThis makes it easy to include links to static assets in your theme. For\nexample, if your theme includes a \njs\n folder, to include \ntheme.js\n from that\nfolder on all pages you would do this:\n\n\nscript src=\n{{ base_url }}/js/theme.js\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nhomepage_url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProvides a relative path to the documentation homepage.\n\n\nmkdocs_version\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains the current MkDocs version.\n\n\nbuild_date_utc\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA Python datetime object that represents the date and time the documentation\nwas built in UTC. This is useful for showing how recently the documentation\nwas updated.\n\n\nPage Context\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe page context includes all of the above Global context and the following\nadditional variables.\n\n\npage_title\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains the Title for the current page.\n\n\npage_description\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains the description for the current page on the homepage, it is blank on\nother pages.\n\n\ncontent\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe rendered Markdown as HTML, this is the contents of the documentation.\n\n\ntoc\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAn object representing the Table of contents for a page. Displaying the table\nof contents as a simple list can be achieved like this.\n\n\nul\n\n{% for toc_item in toc %}\n    \nli\na href=\n{{ toc_item.url }}\n{{ toc_item.title }}\n/a\n/li\n\n    {% for toc_item in toc_item.children %}\n        \nli\na href=\n{{ toc_item.url }}\n{{ toc_item.title }}\n/a\n/li\n\n    {% endfor %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA mapping of the metadata included at the top of the markdown page. In this\nexample we define a \nsource\n property above the page title.\n\n\nsource: generics.py\n        mixins.py\n\n# Page title\n\nContent...\n\n\n\n\nA template can access this metadata for the page with the \nmeta.source\n\nvariable. This could then be used to link to source files related to the\ndocumentation page.\n\n\n{% for filename in meta.source %}\n  \na class=\ngithub\n href=\nhttps://github.com/.../{{ filename }}\n\n    \nspan class=\nlabel label-info\n{{ filename }}\n/span\n\n  \n/a\n\n{% endfor %}\n\n\n\n\ncanonical_url\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe full, canonical URL to the current page. This includes the site_url from\nthe configuration.\n\n\ncurrent_page\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe page object for the current page. The page path and url properties can be\ndisplayed like this.\n\n\nh1\n{{ current_page.title }}\n/h1\n\n\np\n This page is at {{ current_page.url }}\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious_page\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe page object for the previous  page. The usage is the same as for\n\ncurrent_page\n.\n\n\nnext_page\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe page object for the next page.The usage is the same as for \ncurrent_page\n.\n\n\nExtra Context\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAdditional variables can be passed to the template with the\n\nextra\n configuration option. This is a\nset of key value pairs that can make custom templates far more flexible.\n\n\nFor example, this could be used to include the project version of all pages\nand a list of links related to the project. This can be achieved with the\nfollowing \nextra\n configuration:\n\n\nextra:\n    version: 0.13.0\n    links:\n        - https://github.com/mkdocs\n        - https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/builds.html#mkdocs\n        - http://www.mkdocs.org/\n\n\n\n\nAnd then displayed with this HTML in the custom theme.\n\n\n{{ config.extra.version }}\n\n{% if config.extra.links %}\n  \nul\n\n  {% for link in config.extra.links %}\n      \nli\n{{ link }}\n/li\n\n  {% endfor %}\n  \n/ul\n\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\n\nSearch and themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs of MkDocs \n0.13\n client side search support has been added to MkDocs with\n\nLunr.js\n.\n\n\nSearch can either be added to every page in the theme or to a dedicated\ntemplate which must be named \nsearch.html\n. The search template will be build\nwith the same name and can be viewable with \nmkdocs serve\n at\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/search.html\n. An example of the two different\napproaches can be seen by comparing the \nmkdocs\n and \nreadthedocs\n themes.\n\n\nThe following HTML needs to be added to the theme so the JavaScript is loaded\nfor Lunr.js.\n\n\nscript\nvar base_url = '{{ base_url }}';\n/script\n\n\nscript data-main=\n{{ base_url }}/mkdocs/js/search.js\n src=\n{{ base_url }}/mkdocs/js/require.js\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe above JavaScript will download the search index, for larger\ndocumentation projects this can be a heavy operation. In those cases, it\nis suggested that you either use the \nsearch.html\n approach to only\ninclude search on one page or load the JavaScript on an event like a form\nsubmit.\n\n\n\n\nThis loads the JavaScript and sets a global variable \nbase_url\n which allows\nthe JavaScript to make the links relative to the current page. The above\nJavaScript, with the following HTML in a \nsearch.html\n template will add a\nfull search implementation to your theme.\n\n\nh1 id=\nsearch\nSearch Results\n/h1\n\n\n\nform action=\nsearch.html\n\n  \ninput name=\nq\n id=\nmkdocs-search-query\n type=\ntext\n \n\n\n/form\n\n\n\ndiv id=\nmkdocs-search-results\n\n  Sorry, page not found.\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nThis works by looking for the specific ID's used in the above HTML. The input\nfor the user to type the search query must have the ID \nmkdocs-search-query\n\nand \nmkdocs-search-results\n is the directory where the results will be placed.\n\n\nPackaging Themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMkDocs makes use of \nPython packaging\n to distribute themes. This comes with a\nfew requirements.\n\n\nTo see an example of a package containing one theme, see the \nMkDocs Bootstrap\ntheme\n and to see a package that contains many themes, see the \nMkDocs\nBootswatch theme\n.\n\n\nPackage Layout\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following layout is recommended for themes. Two files at the top level\ndirectory called \nMANIFEST.in\n amd \nsetup.py\n. Then a directory with the name\nof your theme and containing a \nbase.html\n file and a \n__init__.py\n.\n\n\n.\n|-- MANIFEST.in\n|-- theme_name\n|   |-- base.html\n|   |-- __init__.py\n`-- setup.py\n\n\n\n\nThe \nMANIFEST.in\n file should contain the following contents but with\ntheme_name updated and any extra file extensions added to the include.\n\n\nrecursive-include theme_name *.ico *.js *.css *.png *.html *.eot *.svg *.ttf *.woff\nrecursive-exclude * __pycache__\nrecursive-exclude * *.py[co]\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsetup.py\n should include the following text with the modifications\ndescribed below.\n\n\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nVERSION = '0.0.1'\n\n\nsetup(\n    name=\nmkdocs-themename\n,\n    version=VERSION,\n    url='',\n    license='',\n    description='',\n    author='',\n    author_email='',\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    include_package_data=True,\n    entry_points={\n        'mkdocs.themes': [\n            'themename = theme_name',\n        ]\n    },\n    zip_safe=False\n)\n\n\n\n\nFill in the URL, license, description, author and author email address.\n\n\nThe name should follow the convention \nmkdocs-themename\n (like \nmkdocs-\nbootstrap\n and \nmkdocs-bootswatch\n), starting with MkDocs, using hyphens to\nseparate words and including the name of your theme.\n\n\nMost of the rest of the file can be left unedited. The last section we need to\nchange is the entry_points. This is how MkDocs finds the theme(s) you are\nincluding in the package. The name on the left is the one that users will use\nin their mkdocs.yml and the one on the right is the directory containing your\ntheme files.\n\n\nThe directory you created at the start of this section with the base.html file\nshould contain all of the other theme files. The minimum requirement is that\nit includes a \nbase.html\n for the theme. It \nmust\n also include a\n\n__init__.py\n file which should be empty, this file tells Python that the\ndirectory is a package.\n\n\nDistributing Themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWith the above changes, your theme should now be ready to install. This can be\ndone with pip, using \npip install .\n if you are still in the same directory as\nthe setup.py.\n\n\nMost Python packages, including MkDocs, are distributed on PyPI. To do this,\nyou should run the following command.\n\n\npython setup.py register\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have an account setup, you should be prompted to create one.\n\n\nFor a much more detailed guide, see the official Python packaging\ndocumentation for \nPackaging and Distributing Projects\n.",

An example of the two different\napproaches can be seen by comparing the  mkdocs  and  readthedocs  themes.

In those cases, it\nis suggested that you either use the  search.html  approach to only\ninclude search on one page or load the JavaScript on an event like a form\nsubmit.   This loads the JavaScript and sets a global variable  base_url  which allows\nthe JavaScript to make the links relative to the current page.

It will be removed in a \nfuture\nrelease\n of MkDocs, version 1.0 at the latest. The \nmkdocs json\n command\nprovided  a convenient way for users to output the documentation contents as\nJSON files but with the additions of search to MkDocs this functionality is\nduplicated.\n\n\nA new index with all the contents from a MkDocs build is created in the\n\nsite_dir\n, so with the default value for the \nsite_dir\n It can be found in\n\nsite/mkdocs/search_index.json\n.\n\n\nThis new file is created on every MkDocs build (with \nmkdocs build\n) and\nno configuration is needed to enable it.\n\n\nChange the pages configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nProvide a \nnew way\n to define pages, and specifically \nnested pages\n, in the\nmkdocs.yml file and deprecate the existing approach, support will be removed\nwith MkDocs 1.0.\n\n\nWarn users about the removal of builtin themes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAll themes other than mkdocs and readthedocs will be moved into external\npackages in a future release of MkDocs. This will enable them to be more easily\nsupported and updates outside MkDocs releases.\n\n\nMajor Additions to Version 0.13.0\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSearch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSupport for search has now been added to MkDocs. This is based on the\nJavaScript library \nlunr.js\n. It has been added to both the \nmkdocs\n and\n\nreadthedocs\n themes. See the custom theme documentation on \nsupporting search\n\nfor adding it to your own themes.\n\n\nNew Command Line Interface\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe command line interface for MkDocs has been re-written with the Python\nlibrary \nClick\n. This means that MkDocs now has an easier to use interface\nwith better help output.\n\n\nThis change is partially backwards incompatible as while undocumented it was\npossible to pass any configuration option to the different commands. Now only\na small subset of the configuration options can be passed to the commands. To\nsee in full commands and available arguments use \nmkdocs --help\n and\n\nmkdocs build --help\n to have them displayed.\n\n\nSupport Extra HTML and XML files\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLike the \nextra_javascript\n and \nextra_css\n configuration options, a new\noption named \nextra_templates\n has been added. This will automatically be\npopulated with any \n.html\n or \n.xml\n files in the project docs directory.\n\n\nUsers can place static HTML and XML files and they will be copied over, or they\ncan also use Jinja2 syntax and take advantage of the \nglobal variables\n.\n\n\nBy default MkDocs will use this approach to create a sitemap for the\ndocumentation.\n\n\nOther Changes and Additions to Version 0.13.0\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nAdd support for \nMarkdown extension configuration options\n. (#435)\n\n\nMkDocs now ships Python \nwheels\n. (#486)\n\n\nOnly include the build date and MkDocs version on the homepage. (#490)\n\n\nGenerate sitemaps for documentation builds. (#436)\n\n\nAdd a clearer way to define nested pages in the configuration. (#482)\n\n\nAdd an \nextra config\n option for passing arbitrary variables to the template. (#510)\n\n\nAdd \n--no-livereload\n to \nmkdocs serve\n for a simpler development server. (#511)\n\n\nAdd copyright display support to all themes (#549)\n\n\nAdd support for custom commit messages in a \nmkdocs gh-deploy\n (#516)\n\n\nBugfix: Fix linking to media within the same directory as a markdown file\n  called index.md (#535)\n\n\nBugfix: Fix errors with unicode filenames (#542).\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.12.2 (2015-04-22)\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nBugfix: Fix a regression where there would be an error if some child titles\n  were missing but others were provided in the pages config. (#464)\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.12.1 (2015-04-14)\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nBugfix: Fixed a CSS bug in the table of contents on some browsers where the\n  bottom item was not clickable.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.12.0 (2015-04-14)\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the current MkDocs version in the CLI output.

(#382)\n\n\nStandardise highlighting across all themes and add missing languages. (#387)\n\n\nAdd a verbose flag. (-v) to show more details about what the build. (#147)\n\n\nAdd the option to specify a remote branch when deploying to GitHub. This\n  enables deploying to GitHub pages on personal and repo sites. (#354)\n\n\nAdd favicon support to the ReadTheDocs theme HTML. (#422)\n\n\nAutomatically refresh the browser when files are edited. (#163)\n\n\nBugfix: Never re-write URL's in code blocks.
