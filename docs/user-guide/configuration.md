# Configuration

Guide to all available configuration settings.

---

## Introduction

Project settings are configured by default using a YAML configuration file in
the project directory named `mkdocs.yml`. You can specify another path for it
by using the `-f`/`--config-file` option (see `mkdocs build --help`).

At a minimum, this configuration file must contain the `site_name`. All other settings are optional.

## Project information

### site_name

This is a **required setting**, and should be a string that is used as the main
title for the project documentation. For example:

```yaml
site_name: Marshmallow Generator
```

When rendering the theme this setting will be passed as the `site_name` context
variable.

### site_url

Set the canonical URL of the site. This will add a `link` tag with the
`canonical` URL to the `head` section of each HTML page. If the 'root' of the
MkDocs site will be within a subdirectory of a domain, be sure to include that
subdirectory in the setting (`https://example.com/foo/`).

This setting is also used for `mkdocs serve`: the server will be mounted onto a
path taken from the path component of the URL, e.g. `some/page.md` will be
served from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/some/page/` to mimic the expected remote
layout.

**default**: `null`

### repo_url

When set, provides a link to your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...)
on each page.

```yaml
repo_url: https://github.com/example/repository/
```

**default**: `null`

### repo_name

When set, provides the name for the link to your repository on each page.

**default**: `'GitHub'`, `'Bitbucket'` or `'GitLab'` if the `repo_url` matches
those domains, otherwise the hostname from the `repo_url`.

### edit_uri

The path from the base `repo_url` to the docs directory when directly viewing a
page, accounting for specifics of the repository host (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket,
etc), the branch, and the docs directory itself. MkDocs concatenates `repo_url`
and `edit_uri`, and appends the input path of the page.

When set, and if your theme supports it, provides a link directly to the page in
your source repository. This makes it easier to find and edit the source for the
page. If `repo_url` is not set, this option is ignored. On some themes, setting
this option may cause an edit link to be used in place of a repository link.
Other themes may show both links.

The `edit_uri` supports query ('?') and fragment ('#') characters. For
repository hosts that use a query or a fragment to access the files, the
`edit_uri` might be set as follows. (Note the `?` and `#` in the URI...)

```yaml
# Query string example
edit_uri: '?query=root/path/docs/'
```

```yaml
# Hash fragment example
edit_uri: '#root/path/docs/'
```

For other repository hosts, simply specify the relative path to the docs
directory.

```yaml
# Query string example
edit_uri: root/path/docs/
```

For example, having this config:

```yaml
repo_url: https://example.com/project/repo
edit_uri: blob/main/docs/
```

means that a page named 'foo/bar.md' will have its edit link lead to:  
<https://example.com/project/repo/blob/main/docs/foo/bar.md>

`edit_uri` can actually be just an absolute URL, not necessarily relative to `repo_url`, so this can achieve the same result:

```yaml
edit_uri: https://example.com/project/repo/blob/main/docs/
```

For more flexibility, see [edit_uri_template](#edit_uri_template) below.

> NOTE:
> On a few known hosts (specifically GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab), the
> `edit_uri` is derived from the 'repo_url' and does not need to be set
> manually. Simply defining a `repo_url` will automatically populate the
> `edit_uri` configs setting.
>
> For example, for a GitHub- or GitLab-hosted repository, the `edit_uri`
> would be automatically set as `edit/master/docs/` (Note the `edit` path
> and `master` branch).
>
> For a Bitbucket-hosted repository, the equivalent `edit_uri` would be
> automatically set as `src/default/docs/` (note the `src` path and `default`
> branch).
>
> To use a different URI than the default (for example a different branch),
> simply set the `edit_uri` to your desired string. If you do not want any
> "edit URL link" displayed on your pages, then set `edit_uri` to an empty
> string to disable the automatic setting.

WARNING:
On GitHub and GitLab, the default "edit" path (`edit/master/docs/`) opens
the page in the online editor. This functionality requires that the user
have and be logged in to a GitHub/GitLab account. Otherwise, the user will
be redirected to a login/signup page. Alternatively, use the "blob" path
(`blob/master/docs/`) to open a read-only view, which supports anonymous
access.

**default**: `edit/master/docs/` for GitHub and GitLab repos or
`src/default/docs/` for a Bitbucket repo, if `repo_url` matches those domains,
otherwise `null`

### edit_uri_template

The more flexible variant of [edit_uri](#edit_uri). These two are equivalent:

```yaml
edit_uri: 'blob/main/docs/'
edit_uri_template: 'blob/main/docs/{path}'
```

(they are also mutually exclusive -- don't specify both).

Starting from here, you can change the positioning or formatting of the path, in case the default behavior of appending the path isn't enough.

The contents of `edit_uri_template` are normal [Python format strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings), with only these fields available:

* `{path}`, e.g. `foo/bar.md`
* `{path_noext}`, e.g. `foo/bar`

And the conversion flag `!q` is available, to percent-encode the field:

* `{path!q}`, e.g. `foo%2Fbar.md`

**default**: `null`

### site_description

Set the site description. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML header.

**default**: `null`

### site_author

Set the name of the author. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML
header.

**default**: `null`

### copyright

Set the copyright information to be included in the documentation by the theme.

**default**: `null`

### remote_branch

Set the remote branch to commit to when using `gh-deploy` to deploy to GitHub
Pages. This option can be overridden by a command line option in `gh-deploy`.

**default**: `gh-pages`

### remote_name

Set the remote name to push to when using `gh-deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
This option can be overridden by a command line option in `gh-deploy`.

**default**: `origin`

## Documentation layout

### nav

This setting is used to determine the format and layout of the global navigation
for the site. A minimal navigation configuration could look like this:

```yaml
nav:
  - 'index.md'
  - 'about.md'
```

All paths in the navigation configuration must be relative to the
[`docs_dir`](#docs_dir) configuration option. See the section on [configuring
pages and navigation] for a more detailed breakdown, including how to create
sub-sections.

Navigation items may also include links to external sites. While titles are
optional for internal links, they are required for external links. An external
link may be a full URL or a relative URL. Any path which is not found in the
files is assumed to be an external link. See the section about [Meta-Data] on
how MkDocs determines the page title of a document.

```yaml
nav:
  - Introduction: 'index.md'
  - 'about.md'
  - 'Issue Tracker': 'https://example.com/'
```

In the above example, the first two items point to local files while the third
points to an external site.

However, sometimes the MkDocs site is hosted in a subdirectory of a project's
site and you may want to link to other parts of the same site without including
the full domain. In that case, you may use an appropriate relative URL.

```yaml
site_url: https://example.com/foo/

nav:
  - Home: '../'
  - 'User Guide': 'user-guide.md'
  - 'Bug Tracker': '/bugs/'
```

In the above example, two different styles of external links are used. First,
note that the `site_url` indicates that the MkDocs site is hosted in the `/foo/`
subdirectory of the domain. Therefore, the `Home` navigation item is a relative
link that steps up one level to the server root and effectively points to
`https://example.com/`. The `Bug Tracker` item uses an absolute path from the
server root and effectively points to `https://example.com/bugs/`. Of course, the
`User Guide` points to a local MkDocs page.

**default**: By default `nav` will contain an alphanumerically sorted, nested
list of all the Markdown files found within the `docs_dir` and its
sub-directories. Index files will always be listed first within a sub-section.

### exclude_docs

NEW: **New in version 1.5.**

> DANGER: **Changed in version 1.6:**
>
> This config no longer applies the "drafts" functionality for `mkdocs serve`. If you have draft documents that you want available in "serve" and not "build", replace `exclude_docs` with the new [`draft_docs`](#draft_docs) config option.

This config defines patterns of files (under [`docs_dir`](#docs_dir)) to not be picked up into the built site.

Example:

```yaml
exclude_docs: |
  # A file with this name anywhere.
  api-config.json

  # Top-level "docs/requirements.txt".
  /requirements.txt

  # Any file with this extension anywhere.
  *.py

  # But keep this particular file.
  !/foo/example.py
```

This follows the [.gitignore pattern format](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).

The following defaults are always implicitly prepended - to exclude dot-files (and directories) as well as the top-level `templates` directory:

```yaml
exclude_docs: |
  .*
  /templates/
```

So, in order to really start this config fresh, you'd need to specify a negated version of these entries first.

Otherwise you could for example opt only certain dot-files back into the site:

```yaml
exclude_docs: |
  # Don't exclude '.assets' although all other '.*' are excluded
  !.assets
```

### draft_docs

NEW: **New in version 1.6.**

This config defines patterns of files (under [`docs_dir`](#docs_dir)) to be treated as a draft.  Draft files are available during `mkdocs serve` and include a "DRAFT" mark but will not be included in the build. To prevent this effect and make "serve" behave the same as "build", you can run `mkdocs serve --clean`.

Example:

```yaml
draft_docs: |
  # A "drafts" directory anywhere.
  drafts/

  # A Markdown file ending in _unpublished.md anywhere.
  *_unpublished.md

  # But keep this particular file.
  !/foo_unpublished.md
```

This follows the [.gitignore pattern format](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format).

### not_in_nav

NEW: **New in version 1.5.**

> NEW: **New in version 1.6:**
>
> If the [`nav`](#nav) config is not specified at all, pages specified in this config will now be excluded from the inferred navigation.

If you want to include some docs into the site but intentionally exclude them from the nav, normally MkDocs warns about this.

Adding such patterns of files (relative to [`docs_dir`](#docs_dir)) into the `not_in_nav` config will prevent such warnings.

Example:

```yaml
nav:
  - Foo: foo.md
  - Bar: bar.md

not_in_nav: |
  /private.md
```

As the previous option, this follows the .gitignore pattern format.

NOTE: Adding a given file to [`exclude_docs`](#exclude_docs) takes precedence over and implies `not_in_nav`.

### validation

NEW: **New in version 1.5.**

Configure the strictness of MkDocs' diagnostic messages when validating links to documents.

This is a tree of configs, and for each one the value can be one of the three: `warn`, `info`, `ignore`. Which cause a logging message of the corresponding severity to be produced. The `warn` level is, of course, intended for use with `mkdocs build --strict` (where it becomes an error), which you can employ in continuous testing.

The config `validation.links.absolute_links` additionally has a special value `relative_to_docs`, for [validation of absolute links](#validation-of-absolute-links).

>? EXAMPLE: **Defaults of this config as of MkDocs 1.6:**
>
> ```yaml
> validation:
>   nav:
>     omitted_files: info
>     not_found: warn
>     absolute_links: info
>   links:
>     not_found: warn
>     anchors: info
>     absolute_links: info
>     unrecognized_links: info
> ```
>
> (Note: you shouldn't copy this whole example, because it only duplicates the defaults. Only individual items that differ should be set.)

The defaults of some of the behaviors already differ from MkDocs 1.4 and below - they were ignored before.

>? EXAMPLE: **Configure MkDocs 1.6 to behave like MkDocs 1.4 and below (reduce strictness):**
>
> ```yaml
> validation:
>   absolute_links: ignore
>   unrecognized_links: ignore
>   anchors: ignore
> ```
<!-- -->
>! EXAMPLE: **Recommended settings for most sites (maximal strictness):**
>
> ```yaml
> validation:
>   omitted_files: warn
>   absolute_links: warn  # Or 'relative_to_docs' - new in MkDocs 1.6
>   unrecognized_links: warn
>   anchors: warn  # New in MkDocs 1.6
> ```

Note how in the above examples we omitted the 'nav' and 'links' keys. Here `absolute_links:` means setting both `nav: absolute_links:` and `links: absolute_links:`.

Full list of values and examples of log messages that they can hide or make more prominent:

*   `validation.nav.omitted_files`
    * > The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in the "nav" configuration: ...
*   `validation.nav.not_found`
    * > A reference to 'foo/bar.md' is included in the 'nav' configuration, which is not found in the documentation files.
    * > A reference to 'foo/bar.md' is included in the 'nav' configuration, but this file is excluded from the built site.
*   `validation.nav.absolute_links`
    * > An absolute path to '/foo/bar.html' is included in the 'nav' configuration, which presumably points to an external resource.
<!-- -->
*   `validation.links.not_found`
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains a link '../foo/bar.md', but the target is not found among documentation files.
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains a link to 'foo/bar.md' which is excluded from the built site.
*   `validation.links.anchors`
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains a link '../foo/bar.md#some-heading', but the doc 'foo/bar.md' does not contain an anchor '#some-heading'.
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains a link '#some-heading', but there is no such anchor on this page.
*   `validation.links.absolute_links`
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains an absolute link '/foo/bar.html', it was left as is. Did you mean 'foo/bar.md'?
*   `validation.links.unrecognized_links`
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains an unrecognized relative link '../foo/bar/', it was left as is. Did you mean 'foo/bar.md'?
    * > Doc file 'example.md' contains an unrecognized relative link 'mail\@example.com', it was left as is. Did you mean 'mailto:mail\@example.com'?

#### Validation of absolute links

NEW: **New in version 1.6.**

> Historically, within Markdown, MkDocs only recognized **relative** links that lead to another physical `*.md` document (or media file). This is a good convention to follow because then the source pages are also freely browsable without MkDocs, for example on GitHub. Whereas absolute links were left unmodified (making them often not work as expected) or, more recently, warned against. If you dislike having to always use relative links, now you can opt into absolute links and have them work correctly.

If you set the setting `validation.links.absolute_links` to the new value `relative_to_docs`, all Markdown links starting with `/` will be understood as being relative to the `docs_dir` root. The links will then be validated for correctness according to all the other rules that were already working for relative links in prior versions of MkDocs. For the HTML output, these links will still be turned relative so that the site still works reliably.

So, now any document (e.g. "dir1/foo.md") can link to the document "dir2/bar.md" as `[link](/dir2/bar.md)`, in addition to the previously only correct way `[link](../dir2/bar.md)`.

You have to enable the setting, though. The default is still to just skip the link.

> EXAMPLE: **Settings to recognize absolute links and validate them:**
>
> ```yaml
> validation:
>   links:
>     absolute_links: relative_to_docs
>     anchors: warn
>     unrecognized_links: warn
> ```

## Build directories

### theme

Sets the theme and theme specific configuration of your documentation site.
May be either a string or a set of key/value pairs.

If a string, it must be the string name of a known installed theme. For a list
of available themes visit [Choosing Your Theme].

An example set of key/value pairs might look something like this:

```yaml
theme:
  name: mkdocs
  locale: en
  custom_dir: my_theme_customizations/
  static_templates:
    - sitemap.html
  include_sidebar: false
```

If a set of key/value pairs, the following nested keys can be defined:

> BLOCK:
>
> #### name
>
> The string name of a known installed theme. For a list of available themes
> visit [Choosing Your Theme].
>
> #### locale
>
> A code representing the language of your site. See [Localizing your theme]
> for details.
>
> #### custom_dir
>
> A directory containing a custom theme. This can either be a relative
> directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the directory containing
> your configuration file or it can be an absolute directory path from the
> root of your local file system.
>
> See [Customizing Your Theme][theme_dir] for details if you would like to tweak an
> existing theme.
>
> See the [Theme Developer Guide] if you would like to build your own theme
> from the ground up.
>
> #### static_templates
>
> A list of templates to render as static pages. The templates must be located
> in either the theme's template directory or in the `custom_dir` defined in
> the theme configuration.
>
> #### (theme specific keywords)
>
> Any additional keywords supported by the theme can also be defined. See the
> documentation for the theme you are using for details.

**default**: `'mkdocs'`

### docs_dir

The directory containing the documentation source markdown files. This can
either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the
directory containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute directory
path from the root of your local file system.

**default**: `'docs'`

### site_dir

The directory where the output HTML and other files are created. This can either
be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the directory
containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute directory path from
the root of your local file system.

**default**: `'site'`

> NOTE:
> If you are using source code control you will normally want to ensure that
> your *build output* files are not committed into the repository, and only
> keep the *source* files under version control. For example, if using `git`
> you might add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:
>
> ```text
> site/
> ```
>
> If you're using another source code control tool, you'll want to check its
> documentation on how to ignore specific directories.

### extra_css

Set a list of CSS files (relative to `docs_dir`) to be included by the theme, typically as `<link>` tags.

Example:

```yaml
extra_css:
  - css/extra.css
  - css/second_extra.css
```

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

### extra_javascript

Set a list of JavaScript files in your `docs_dir` to be included by the theme, as `<script>` tags.

> NEW: **Changed in version 1.5:**
>
> Older versions of MkDocs supported only a plain list of strings, but now several additional config keys are available: `type`, `async`, `defer`.

See the examples and what they produce:

```yaml
extra_javascript:
  - some_plain_javascript.js       # <script src="some_plain_javascript.js"></script>
        # New behavior in MkDocs 1.5:
  - implicitly_as_module.mjs       # <script src="implicitly_as_module.mjs" type="module"></script>
        # Config keys only supported since MkDocs 1.5:
  - path: explicitly_as_module.mjs # <script src="explicitly_as_module.mjs" type="module"></script>
    type: module
  - path: deferred_plain.js        # <script src="deferred_plain.js" defer></script>
    defer: true
  - path: scripts/async_module.mjs # <script src="scripts/async_module.mjs" type="module" async></script>
    type: module
    async: true
```

So, each item can be either:

* a plain string, or
* a mapping that has the required `path` key and 3 optional keys `type` (string), `async` (boolean), `defer` (boolean).

Only the plain string variant detects the `.mjs` extension and adds `type="module"`, otherwise `type: module` must be written out regardless of extension.

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

NOTE: `*.js` and `*.css` files, just like any other type of file, are always copied from `docs_dir` into the site's deployed copy, regardless if they're linked to the pages via the above configs or not.

### extra_templates

Set a list of templates in your `docs_dir` to be built by MkDocs. To see more
about writing templates for MkDocs read the documentation about [custom themes]
and specifically the section about the [available variables] to
templates. See the example in [extra_css] for usage.

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

### extra

A set of key-value pairs, where the values can be any valid YAML construct, that
will be passed to the template. This allows for great flexibility when creating
custom themes.

For example, if you are using a theme that supports displaying the project
version, you can pass it to the theme like this:

```yaml
extra:
  version: 1.0
```

**default**: By default `extra` will be an empty key-value mapping.

## Preview controls

## Live Reloading

### watch

Determines additional directories to watch when running `mkdocs serve`.
Configuration is a YAML list.

```yaml
watch:
  - directory_a
  - directory_b
```

Allows a custom default to be set without the need to pass it through the `-w`/`--watch`
option every time the `mkdocs serve` command is called.

> NOTE:
> The paths provided via the configuration file are relative to the configuration file.
>
> The paths provided via the `-w`/`--watch` CLI parameters are not.

### use_directory_urls

This setting controls the directory structure of the generated documentation, and thereby the URL format used for linking to pages.

The following tables demonstrate how the directory structure and URLs used on the site differ when
setting `use_directory_urls` to `true` or `false`.

**`use_directory_urls: false`**

This setting is needed when the documentation is hosted on systems that can't
access the file `X/index.html` when given the URL `X`. When set to `false`,
no additional `X` directory is created, and the file is simply stored as `X.html`.
Links are created that point directly to the target *file* rather than a target
*directory*.

Source file      | Generated File     | URL Format
---------------- | ------------------ | -------------------
index.md         | index.html         | /index.html
api-guide.md     | api-guide.html     | /api-guide.html
about/license.md | about/license.html | /about/license.html

For example, this needs to be set to `false` when:

* opening pages directly from the file system
* publishing the documentation to a static S3 website.

**`use_directory_urls: true`**

The default style of `use_directory_urls: true` creates more user friendly URLs,
and is usually what you'll want to use.

Source file      | Generated File            | URL Format
---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------
index.md         | /index.html               | /
api-guide.md     | /api-guide/index.html     | /api-guide/
about/license.md | /about/license/index.html | /about/license

**default**: `true`

### strict

Determines how warnings are handled. Set to `true` to halt processing when a
warning is raised. Set to `false` to print a warning and continue processing.

This is also available as a command line flag: `--strict`.

**default**: `false`

### dev_addr

Determines the address used when running `mkdocs serve`. Must be of the format
`IP:PORT`.

Allows a custom default to be set without the need to pass it through the
`--dev-addr` option every time the `mkdocs serve` command is called.

**default**: `'127.0.0.1:8000'`

See also: [site_url](#site_url).

## Formatting options

### markdown_extensions

MkDocs uses the [Python Markdown][pymkd] library to translate Markdown files
into HTML. Python Markdown supports a variety of [extensions][pymdk-extensions]
that customize how pages are formatted. This setting lets you enable a list of
extensions beyond the ones that MkDocs uses by default (`meta`, `toc`, `tables`,
and `fenced_code`).

For example, to enable the [SmartyPants typography extension][smarty], use:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - smarty
```

Some extensions provide configuration options of their own. If you would like to
set any configuration options, then you can nest a key/value mapping
(`option_name: option value`) of any options that a given extension supports.
See the documentation for the extension you are using to determine what options
they support.

For example, to enable permalinks in the (included) `toc` extension, use:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - toc:
      permalink: true
```

Note that a colon (`:`) must follow the extension name (`toc`) and then on a new
line the option name and value must be indented and separated by a colon. If you
would like to define multiple options for a single extension, each option must be
defined on a separate line:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - toc:
      permalink: true
      separator: "_"
```

Add an additional item to the list for each extension. If you have no
configuration options to set for a specific extension, then simply omit options
for that extension:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - smarty
  - toc:
      permalink: true
  - sane_lists
```

> NOTE: **Dynamic config values.**
>
> To dynamically configure the extensions, you can get the config values from [environment variables](#environment-variables) or [obtain paths](#paths-relative-to-the-current-file-or-site) of the currently rendered Markdown file or the overall MkDocs site.

In the above examples, each extension is a list item (starts with a `-`). As an
alternative, key/value pairs can be used instead. However, in that case an empty
value must be provided for extensions for which no options are defined.
Therefore, the last example above could also be defined as follows:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  smarty: {}
  toc:
    permalink: true
  sane_lists: {}
```

This alternative syntax is required if you intend to override some options via
[inheritance].

> NOTE: **More extensions.**
>
> The Python-Markdown documentation provides a [list of extensions][exts]
> which are available out-of-the-box. For a list of configuration options
> available for a given extension, see the documentation for that extension.
>
> You may also install and use various third party extensions ([Python-Markdown wiki], [MkDocs project catalog][catalog]). Consult
> the documentation provided by those extensions for installation instructions
> and available configuration options.

**default**: `[]` (an empty list).

### hooks

NEW: **New in version 1.4.**

A list of paths to Python scripts (relative to `mkdocs.yml`) that are loaded and used as [plugin](#plugins) instances.

For example:

```yaml
hooks:
  - my_hooks.py
```

Then the file `my_hooks.py` can contain any [plugin event handlers](../dev-guide/plugins.md#events) (without `self`), e.g.:

```python
def on_page_markdown(markdown, **kwargs):
    return markdown.replace('a', 'z')
```

>? EXAMPLE: **Advanced example:**
>
> This produces warnings based on the Markdown content (and warnings are fatal in [strict](#strict) mode):
>
> ```python
> import logging, re
> import mkdocs.plugins
>
> log = logging.getLogger('mkdocs')
>
> @mkdocs.plugins.event_priority(-50)
> def on_page_markdown(markdown, page, **kwargs):
>     path = page.file.src_uri
>     for m in re.finditer(r'\bhttp://[^) ]+', markdown):
>         log.warning(f"Documentation file '{path}' contains a non-HTTPS link: {m[0]}")
> ```

This does not enable any new abilities compared to [plugins][], it only simplifies one-off usages, as these don't need to be *installed* like plugins do.

Note that for `mkdocs serve` the hook module will *not* be reloaded on each build.

You might have seen this feature in the [mkdocs-simple-hooks plugin](https://github.com/aklajnert/mkdocs-simple-hooks). If using standard method names, it can be directly replaced, e.g.:

```diff
-plugins:
-  - mkdocs-simple-hooks:
-      hooks:
-        on_page_markdown: 'my_hooks:on_page_markdown'
+hooks:
+  - my_hooks.py
```

> NEW: **New in MkDocs 1.6.**
>
> If a hook file has a file `foo.py` adjacent to it, it can use the normal Python syntax `import foo` to access its functions.
>
> In older versions of MkDocs, a workaround was necessary to make this work - adding the path to `sys.path`.

### plugins

A list of plugins (with optional configuration settings) to use when building
the site. See the [Plugins] documentation for full details.

**default**: `['search']` (the "search" plugin included with MkDocs).

If the `plugins` config setting is defined in the `mkdocs.yml` config file, then
any defaults (such as `search`) are ignored and you need to explicitly re-enable
the defaults if you would like to continue using them:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - your_other_plugin
```

To define options for a given plugin, use a nested set of key/value pairs:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - your_other_plugin:
      option1: value
      option2: other value
```

To completely disable all plugins, including any defaults, set the `plugins`
setting to an empty list:

```yaml
plugins: []
```

#### `enabled` option

> NEW: **New in MkDocs 1.6.**
>
> Each plugin has its own options keys. However MkDocs also ensures that each plugin has the `enabled` boolean option. This can be used to conditionally enable a particular plugin, as in the following example:
>
> ```yaml
> plugins:
>   - search
>   - code-validator:
>       enabled: !ENV [LINT, false]
> ```
>
> See: [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

#### Alternate syntax

In the above examples, each plugin is a list item (starts with a `-`). As an
alternative, key/value pairs can be used instead. However, in that case an empty
value must be provided for plugins for which no options are defined. Therefore,
the last example above could also be defined as follows:

```yaml
plugins:
  search: {}
  your_other_plugin:
    option1: value
    option2: other value
```

This alternative syntax is required if you intend to override some options via
[inheritance].

#### Search

A search plugin is provided by default with MkDocs which uses [lunr.js] as a
search engine. The following config options are available to alter the behavior
of the search plugin:

##### **separator**

A regular expression which matches the characters used as word separators when
building the index. By default whitespace and the hyphen (`-`) are used. To add
the dot (`.`) as a word separator you might do this:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search:
      separator: '[\s\-\.]+'
```

**default**: `'[\s\-]+'`

##### **min_search_length**

An integer value that defines the minimum length for a search query. By default
searches shorter than 3 chars in length are ignored as search result quality with
short search terms are poor. However, for some use cases (such as documentation
about Message Queues which might generate searches for 'MQ') it may be preferable
to set a shorter limit.

```yaml
plugins:
  - search:
      min_search_length: 2
```

**default**: 3

##### **lang**

A list of languages to use when building the search index as identified by their
[ISO 639-1] language codes. With [Lunr Languages], the following languages are
supported:

* `ar`: Arabic
* `da`: Danish
* `nl`: Dutch
* `en`: English
* `fi`: Finnish
* `fr`: French
* `de`: German
* `hu`: Hungarian
* `it`: Italian
* `ja`: Japanese
* `no`: Norwegian
* `pt`: Portuguese
* `ro`: Romanian
* `ru`: Russian
* `es`: Spanish
* `sv`: Swedish
* `th`: Thai
* `tr`: Turkish
* `vi`: Vietnamese

You may [contribute additional languages].

WARNING:
While search does support using multiple languages together, it is best not
to add additional languages unless you really need them. Each additional
language adds significant bandwidth requirements and uses more browser
resources. Generally, it is best to keep each instance of MkDocs to a single
language.

NOTE:
Lunr Languages does not currently include support for Chinese or other Asian
languages. However, some users have reported decent results using Japanese.

**default**: The value of `theme.locale` if set, otherwise `[en]`.

##### **prebuild_index**

Optionally generates a pre-built index of all pages, which provides some
performance improvements for larger sites. Before enabling, confirm that the
theme you are using explicitly supports using a prebuilt index (the builtin
themes do). Set to `true` to enable.

WARNING:
This option requires that [Node.js] be installed and the command `node` be
on the system path. If the call to `node` fails for any reason, a warning
is issued and the build continues uninterrupted. You may use the `--strict`
flag when building to cause such a failure to raise an error instead.

NOTE:
On smaller sites, using a pre-built index is not recommended as it creates a
significant increase is bandwidth requirements with little to no noticeable
improvement to your users. However, for larger sites (hundreds of pages),
the bandwidth increase is relatively small and your users will notice a
significant improvement in search performance.

**default**: `False`

##### **indexing**

Configures what strategy the search indexer will use when building the index
for your pages. This property is particularly useful if your project is large
in scale, and the index takes up an enormous amount of disk space.

```yaml
plugins:
  - search:
      indexing: 'full'
```

###### Options

Option | Description
------ | -----------
`full` | Indexes the title, section headings, and full text of each page.
`sections` | Indexes the title and section headings of each page.
`titles` | Indexes only the title of each page.

**default**: `full`

## Special YAML tags

### Environment variables

In most cases, the value of a configuration option is set directly in the
configuration file. However, as an option, the value of a configuration option
may be set to the value of an environment variable using the `!ENV` tag. For
example, to set the value of the `site_name` option to the value of the
variable `SITE_NAME` the YAML file may contain the following:

```yaml
site_name: !ENV SITE_NAME
```

If the environment variable is not defined, then the configuration setting
would be assigned a `null` (or `None` in Python) value. A default value can be
defined as the last value in a list. Like this:

```yaml
site_name: !ENV [SITE_NAME, 'My default site name']
```

Multiple fallback variables can be used as well. Note that the last value is
not an environment variable, but must be a value to use as a default if none
of the specified environment variables are defined.

```yaml
site_name: !ENV [SITE_NAME, OTHER_NAME, 'My default site name']
```

Simple types defined within an environment variable such as string, bool,
integer, float, datestamp and null are parsed as if they were defined directly
in the YAML file, which means that the value will be converted to the
appropriate type. However, complex types such as lists and key/value pairs
cannot be defined within a single environment variable.

For more details, see the [pyyaml_env_tag](https://github.com/waylan/pyyaml-env-tag)
project.

### Paths relative to the current file or site

NEW: **New in version 1.5.**

Some Markdown extensions can benefit from knowing the path of the Markdown file that's currently being processed, or just the root path of the current site. For that, the special tag `!relative` can be used in most contexts within the config file, though the only known usecases are within [`markdown_extensions`](#markdown_extensions).

Examples of the possible values are:

```yaml
- !relative  # Relative to the directory of the current Markdown file
- !relative $docs_dir  # Path of the docs_dir
- !relative $config_dir  # Path of the directory that contains the main mkdocs.yml
- !relative $config_dir/some/child/dir  # Some subdirectory of the root config directory
```

(Here, `$docs_dir` and `$config_dir` are currently the *only* special prefixes that are recognized.)

Example:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.snippets:
      base_path: !relative  # Relative to the current Markdown file
```

This allows the [pymdownx.snippets] extension to include files relative to the current Markdown file, which without this tag it would have no way of knowing.

> NOTE: Even for the default case, any extension's base path is technically the *current working directory* although the assumption is that it's the *directory of mkdocs.yml*. So even if you don't want the paths to be relative, to improve the default behavior, always prefer to use this idiom:
>
> ```yaml
> markdown_extensions:
>   - pymdownx.snippets:
>       base_path: !relative $config_dir  # Relative to the root directory with mkdocs.yml
> ```

## Configuration Inheritance

Generally, a single file would hold the entire configuration for a site.
However, some organizations may maintain multiple sites which all share a common
configuration across them. Rather than maintaining separate configurations for
each, the common configuration options can be defined in a parent configuration
file which each site's primary configuration file inherits.

To define the parent for a configuration file, set the `INHERIT` (all caps) key
to the path of the parent file. The path must be relative to the location of the
primary file.

For configuration options to be merged with a parent configuration, those
options must be defined as key/value pairs. Specifically, the
[markdown_extensions] and [plugins](#plugins) options must use the alternative syntax
which does not use list items (lines which start with  `-`).

For example, suppose the common (parent) configuration is defined in `base.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  name: mkdocs
  locale: en
  highlightjs: true

markdown_extensions:
  toc:
    permalink: true
  admonition: {}
```

Then, for the "foo" site, the primary configuration file would be defined at
`foo/mkdocs.yml`:

```yml
INHERIT: ../base.yml
site_name: Foo Project
site_url: https://example.com/foo
```

When running `mkdocs build`, the file at `foo/mkdocs.yml` would be passed in as
the configuration file. MkDocs will then parse that file, retrieve and parse the
parent file `base.yml` and deep merge the two. This would result in MkDocs
receiving the following merged configuration:

```yaml
site_name: Foo Project
site_url: https://example.com/foo

theme:
  name: mkdocs
  locale: en
  highlightjs: true

markdown_extensions:
  toc:
    permalink: true
  admonition: {}
```

Deep merging allows you to add and/or override various values in your primary
configuration file. For example, suppose for one site you wanted to add support
for definition lists, use a different symbol for permalinks, and define a
different separator. In that site's primary configuration file you could do:

```yaml
INHERIT: ../base.yml
site_name: Bar Project
site_url: https://example.com/bar

markdown_extensions:
  def_list: {}
  toc:
    permalink: 
    separator: "_"
```

In that case, the above configuration would be deep merged with `base.yml` and
result in the following configuration:

```yaml
site_name: Bar Project
site_url: https://example.com/bar

theme:
  name: mkdocs
  locale: en
  highlightjs: true

markdown_extensions:
  def_list: {}
  toc:
    permalink: 
    separator: "_"
  admonition: {}
```

Notice that the `admonition` extension was retained from the parent
configuration, the `def_list` extension was added, the value of
`toc.permalink` was replaced, and the value of `toc.separator` was added.

You can replace or merge the value of any key. However, any non-key is always
replaced. Therefore, you cannot append items to a list. You must redefine the
entire list.

As the [nav] configuration is made up of nested lists, this means that you
cannot merge navigation items. Of course, you can replace the entire `nav`
configuration with a new one. However, it is generally expected that the entire
navigation would be defined in the primary configuration file for a project.

WARNING:
As a reminder, all path based configuration options must be relative to the
primary configuration file and MkDocs does not alter the paths when merging.
Therefore, defining paths in a parent file which is inherited by multiple
different sites may not work as expected. It is generally best to define
path based options in the primary configuration file only.

The inheritance can also be used as a quick way to override keys on the command line - by using stdin as the config file. For example:

```bash
echo '{INHERIT: mkdocs.yml, site_name: "Renamed site"}' | mkdocs build -f -
```
